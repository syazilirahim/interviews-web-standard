# Web Development Interview Test

## Introduction
Welcome to the web development interview test! This task is designed to assess your skills in both backend and frontend development. You will create a simple task application with an API and a client frontend. Follow the instructions carefully and make sure to demonstrate best practices in coding, structure, and git usage.

## Project Structure
You will find two folders in the repository:
- `api`
- `client`

You are required to implement the following within these folders.

## Task Description

### API Project
1. **Technology**: Use [ASP.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet/apis) in .NET 8 written in C#.
2. **Database**: Use SQLite for the database.
3. **ORM**: Use [Entity Framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/) Core as the ORM.
4. **Functionality**: 
    - Create a `Task` model representing a single task.
    - Additionally, create a `Tag` model to represent tags that can be associated with tasks.
    - Implement a many-to-many relationship between `Task` and `Tag` using a join table.
    - Create endpoints for basic CRUD operations:
        - `GET /api/tasks`: Retrieve all tasks.
        - `GET /api/tasks/{id}`: Retrieve a specific task by id.
        - `POST /api/tasks`: Create a new task.
        - `PUT /api/tasks/{id}`: Update an existing task.
        - `DELETE /api/tasks/{id}`: Delete a task.
        - `GET /api/tags`: Retrieve all tags.
        - `POST /api/tags`: Create a new tag.
        - `PUT /api/tags/{id}`: Update an existing tag.
        - `GET /api/tags/{id}/tasks`: Get all tasks for a tag.
        - `DELETE /api/tags/{id}`: Delete a tag.
        - `POST /api/tasks/{id}/tags`: Associate tags with a task.
    - Ensure proper validation, error handling, and logging.
5. **Best Practices**: Follow [RESTful principles](https://restfulapi.net/resource-naming/) for API design.

### Client Project
1. **Technology**: Use [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/installation) for the frontend application.
2. **Functionality**:
    - Create a user interface to display the list of tasks.
    - Allow users to add, update, and delete tasks.
    - Allow users to add, update, and delete tags.
    - Allow users to assign tags to tasks.
    - Interact with the API to perform these operations.
3. **UI/UX**: Ensure the interface is user-friendly and visually appealing.

## Git Workflow
1. **Forking**: Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Branching**: Use a feature-branch workflow. Create branches for different functionalities (e.g., `feature/api-setup`, `feature/client-setup`).
3. **Commits**: Make frequent, clear, and descriptive commits.
4. **Pull Requests**: Once you've completed a feature, create a pull request to merge it into your main branch. Include descriptive messages with your pull requests.
5. **Git Ignore**: Make sure only the necessary files are saved to the repository. Make proper use of gitignore. 

## Additional Requirements
- **Documentation**: Add comments to your code where necessary and provide a brief documentation on how to set up and run the project.
- **Creativity**: Feel free to add any additional features or improvements that you think would make this project stand out.
- **BONUS: Testing**: Implement unit tests for the API or client using a framework of your choice.

## Submission
1. Ensure your project is well-documented.
2. Share the link to your forked repository with us.
3. Be prepared to discuss your code, decisions, and any challenges you faced during the development in a follow-up interview.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Adherence to best practices and coding standards.
- Clean and maintainable code.
- Proper use of git and version control best practices.
- User experience and design of the frontend application.
- Creativity and any additional features implemented.
- Documentation and code comments.

## Getting Started
1. Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the database and run the migrations.
3. Implement the required functionalities in both the `api` and `client` projects.
4. Submit your work as described in the submission section.

We look forward to seeing your solution!
